# Heart Risk Key Indicators EDA and Machine Learning Modeling

In this repository a data analysis of the heart risk key indicators using data from the 2020 annual CDC survey of 400k adults related to their health status is performed. Data was gathered using Kaggle from the [Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) dataset.

The main purpose of this project is to be able to detect the heart risk of a person given information about its physical and mental health. Therefore, the problem I will be solving is a binary classification one.

The process of developing a model consisted of many different parts some of which included exploratory data analysis, model selection, validation and interpretability. The following list includes a Jupyter Notebook for each step:

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](Data_Exploration.ipynb)

2. [Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression](project_1-LogisticRegression.ipynb)

3. [Machine Learning Model: Decision Trees](project_1-Trees.ipynb)

4. [Machine Learning Model: XGBoost](project_1-XGBoost.ipynb)

5. [Best Model Selection](Model_Selection.ipynb)

6. [Model Usage Example](Model_Use.ipynb)

This project sets the foundations for the deployment of this model in a Web Server using Flask. The following [Jupyter Notebook](link) describes how to do it.
